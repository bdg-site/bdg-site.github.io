    <p>Hi Steve!</p>

    <p>
      As you've probably heard we were traded to Calgary!  One of the very
      first things we realized we would miss most was our beautiful home.
      The whole team was like, "Not your gorgeous home!"  We bought a new home
      in Calgary and while we were deciding on it etc. the realtor said, you
      two don't seem excited and I told him its because we were leaving behind
      the most beautiful home we would ever live in. Thank you for that lovely
      home, we had such a lovely time in it!
    </p>

    <p>All the best to you and your family,</p>

      Erik and I went under contract with Steve Brown in April of 2013. We
      moved into our lovely home on December 5, 2014. The entire process from
      beginning to end was so smooth. We had heard horror stories about
      building a house and we experienced nothing but fun and complete
      satisfaction with the process and the completed product. Steve was
      extremely good about communicating with us which kept our fears at bay.
      He helped us find the highest quality products within our budget. He is
      a man of integrity and commitment. I would refer Steve to anyone
      looking to build a new home. They will not be disappointed.

      I would add that they delivered on time in budget and were more than
      fair with honoring everything they agreed to in addition to providing
      some upgrades just as standard practice.  They are solid individuals and
      they work hard to deliver a good product.  We love our house.

      Re: Steve Brown – Brown Group<br>
      Letter of Reference &amp; Recommendation
    </p>

    <p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>

    <p>
      I’m writing to unconditionally endorse and recommend Steve Brown as a
      phenomenal custom home builder. Steve recently worked with my husband
      and I to build our first custom home; We moved in August, 2013.  The
      longer we live in the house, the more we’ve come to appreciate both the
      quality of the home he created for us and our family, as well as the
      exceptional value that we got.
    </p>

    <p>
      Steve was easy to work with throughout the process. He’s accessible, and
      always puts in long hours to make sure deadlines get met.  Like a
      taskmaster, he hounds his subcontractors to put quality workmanship into
      every corner of the home, and to get it done on time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The City of Boulder tried to insert new hurdles and requirements into our
      project at every turn, and Steve expertly helped us navigate the red tape
      to keep our project on time and within budget. By the final inspection,
      the building inspector had been won over too—we were glad to hear from
      his own mouth that it was the “best built house [he’d] seen in over a
      decade as an inspector.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Steve’s attention to detail and creativity are inspiring, and are the
      qualities that elevate him from not just a “good” builder, but to a
      “great” builder in my opinion.  Steve met and exceeded every expectation
      of ours: In everything from expertly finding and combining the best
      materials, to listening to our wants and needs and bringing them to life,
      to adding surprise bells-and-whistles to the house that we never could
      have imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, I highly recommend Steve Brown to you as a custom
      home builder.  A Brown-built house is not just one that you will enjoy
      for years, but is also one that will make you the envy of your neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please feel free to call or email any time if you have any other
      questions about Steve or his work for us.
    </p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p><em>Jennifer N.</em></p>

      I have been working with Stephen Brown, CEO of Brown Development Group,
      for approximately the past eight months designing and building my dream
      home. He's very receptive to my ideas and has guided me through the
      building process. This is my fourth new home build. The process has been
      very stress free and I have enjoyed working with Stephen. He is very
      receptive to changes I have made and respects my busy work schedule to
      schedule times to meet to discuss issues when convenient for me. He has
      been very accessible either by phone, text or email and contacts me
      within a day. The quality of his finishes and his finished homes are
      incredible value and I feel he is a honest homebuilder. I have been able
      to select the finishes of my liking, unlike other builders I have used
      in the past which only provided me with a limited selection of big box
      store items. Now, I feel I have been offered the opportunity to create a
      semi custom home which will reflect my style and not be like the
      neighbors house next door. He is not a big name builder in Denver as of
      yet, but he does build quality high end homes. Moreover, he has a
      great personality and is easy to work with. Based on the aforementioned,
      I would highly recommend Brown Development Group without reservation
      to build anyone their new home!

    <p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>

    <p>
      My husband and I purchased a home built by Steve Brown (Brown
      Development Group) in June 2013. We were very pleased with the
      transaction. Steve and his team were timely and responsive. The crew
      was neat and approachable. I personally trusted all of their design
      decisions. But most refreshingly, I never felt that I was being
      “nickeled and dimed.” They were open to suggestions and flexible to
      making changes along the way. They are a compliment to their industry.
      With confidence I would recommend them to my family and friends.
